## Project Setup

###### N.B. These notes made when setting up the project with a MacBook running High Sierra 10.13.6

See `requirements.txt` for required packages. Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

`xppcall.py` can't be installed via pip - instead directly include file in project. Seems to be outdated!
e.g. print statements aren't methods?

May need to install XPP (interchangably called XPPAUT). Instructions available at http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html.
Add the executable `xppaut` to your `PATH` so that it can be executed (e.g. in `xppcall.py`).
