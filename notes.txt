PROJECT SETUP:
(N.B. I made these notes when setting the project up with a MacBook running High Sierra 10.13.6)


See requirements.txt for required packages. Install via 'pip install -r requirements.txt'


xppcall.py can't be installed via pip - instead directly include file in project. Seems to be outdated!
e.g. print statements aren't methods?


Need to install XPP (interchangably called XPPAUT). Instructions available at 'http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html'
Add the executable 'xppaut' to your PATH so that it can be executed (e.g. in xppcall.py).


INFORMAL SCRIBBLINGS:


Missing file 'tedges_combined_weighted_binary_method_percentage_minmax_p_0.5_clean2.tedges'
