PROJECT SETUP:
(N.B. I made these notes when setting the project up with a MacBook running High Sierra 10.13.6)


See requirements.txt for required packages. Install via 'pip install -r requirements.txt'


xppcall.py can't be installed via pip - instead directly include file in project. Seems to be outdated!
e.g. print statements aren't methods?


Need to install XPP (interchangably called XPPAUT). Instructions available at 'http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html'
Add the executable 'xppaut' to your PATH so that it can be executed (e.g. in xppcall.py).


MORE SCRIBBLINGS:


Missing file 'tedges_combined_weighted_binary_method_percentage_minmax_p_0.5_clean2.tedges' - have used the non-minimax
one instead.

Methods 'compute_snapshot_distances' and 'plot_time_clusters' mentioned in jupyter notebook but missing from
cluster_snapshots.py? Renamed snapshot_distances to compute_snapshot_distances and returned dist_mat as well as
dist_mat_condensed to see if that would get me anywhere.

Cell 20 in notebook doesn't like key CLN3.

Cell 32 says 'dist_mat_full' not defined.
